RegionX - Marketplace and tooling for Coretime

## 1. Introduction

[RegionX](https://regionx.tech/) is a project dedicated to developing components for the new Agile Coretime model. The goal of the project is to enable developer teams, researchers, and speculators to start trading, tracking, and analyzing the product Polkadot offers - Coretime. 

This repository is establishing the smart contract components for creating a secondary Coretime market. This infrastructure is meant to be leveraged by any end-user product built around Coretime.

The repository currently contains two crucial components in the form of ink! contracts that are necessary for the creation of a flexible and decentralized Coretime market.
